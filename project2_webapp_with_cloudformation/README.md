# Project 2 - High-availability web app using CloudFormation
## Overview
In this project we are going to explore CloudFormation as the IaC framework for deploying an web application in AWS. We will also design a cloud infrastructure diagram to illustrate the desired architecture.

## Project Scenario
The project official description is the following:
```
Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram, and the requirement is to deploy this new application to the AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code.

You have been tasked with provisioning the required infrastructure and deploying a dummy application, along with the necessary supporting software.

Since the underlying network infrastructure will be maintained by a separate team, you must create independent stacks for the network infrastructure and the application itself.

Infrastructure spin up and tear down needs to be automated so that each team can create and discard testing environments on demand.
```

## Objectives
1. Create a diagram for the web app cloud architecture
2. Use CloudFormation to deploy the web application on AWS.
